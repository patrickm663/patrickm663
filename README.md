### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an actuarial consultant and developer from Cape Town, South Africa. 

As a consultant, my focus is on applying machine learning to actuarial problems across the end-to-end pipeline.

I am comfortable working with cloud services, and recently passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect exams.

On the actuarial side, I am sitting my Fellowship exams through ASSA.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m focussed on Julia's Turing.jl library for Bayesian modelling, as well as the D programming language
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m exploring the cloud native ecosystem
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaboration
- ðŸ“« You can reach me here on GitHub or my personal site https://patrickmoehrke.com
- ðŸ’¬ I'd love to chat about all things Linux, programming, and ML!
