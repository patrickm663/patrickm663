### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an actuarial consultant and developer from Cape Town, South Africa. 

As a consultant, my focus is on applying machine learning to actuarial problems across the end-to-end pipeline.

I like working with Cloud services and aim to start sitting AWS certification exams this 2023.

On the actuarial side, I am sitting my Fellowship exams through ASSA.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a database backends in AWS and preparing for the Cloud Practitioner's exam
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Julia (SciML-focus), Python's Streamlit for dashboarding, and D programming language
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaboration
- ðŸ“« You can reach me here on GitHub or my personal site https://patrickmoehrke.com
- ðŸ’¬ I'd love to chat about all things Linux, programming, and ML!

#### 2023 Goals â›³
1. Further explore Lua in order to write a custom Conky theme and fine-tune my Neovim config (no ideas at the moment for custom plugins -- ideas are welcome!)
2. Write a 2D game in D - something like a _Yu-Gi-Oh_ or _Duel Masters_ clone
3. Write a small mortality modelling library in Julia, and investigate whether there is scope for neural and universal DEs in mortality modelling
4. Write a small deep learning library in D from scratch, starting with a simple feed-forward networks
5. Rewrite AWS infrastructure for my websites in Terraform
6. Get further in Project Euler, aiming at 60+ complete by year-end (around 45 complete @ start of 2023)
7. Improve my database management skills by integrating/exploring DB integration where possible into the above goals
8. Build better test cases and apply CICD where possible in the above goals and my general work, including integrating it into older repos
9. Begin learning a functional programming language. Candidates are Haskell or OCaml
10. Explore Kubernetes (both EKS and smaller-scale like microk8s or minikube) using custom Docker images and look at packaging up a small example with Helm
11. Develop better monitoring techniques using Grafana and integrate them into AWS services
