### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an actuarial consultant and developer from Cape Town, South Africa. 

As a consultant, my focus is on applying machine learning to actuarial problems across the end-to-end pipeline.

I like working with Cloud services and aim to start sitting AWS certification exams this 2023.

On the actuarial side, I am sitting my Fellowship exams through ASSA.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a database backend for my parents' website and preparing for the Cloud Practitioner's exam
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Julia with Flux.jl, and Python's Streamlit for dashboarding
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaboration
- ðŸ“« You can reach me here on GitHub or my personal site https://patrickmoehrke.com
- ðŸ’¬ I'd love to chat about all things Linux, programming, and ML!
